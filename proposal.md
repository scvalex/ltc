Less Than c
===========

Objective
---------

The ultimate goal of LTc is to develop a replicated key-value store
optimised for the case where the nodes are connected by an
intermittent, high-bandwidth, high-latency link.

By high-latency, we mean that the round-trip time between nodes is
measured in minutes, rather than in milliseconds.

By intermittent, we mean that the link between nodes will be down
regularly for hours at a time.

Additionally, LTc should be able to store terabytes of data.

Motivation
----------

This should explain why the problem and the objective that you are
trying to achieve is interesting and important.

Challenges and Issues to be Solved
----------------------------------

This should explain why the objective is difficult to achieve (see
Project Assessment) and is an initial analysis of the (sub-)problems
you will need to solve.

Approach
--------

This offers some idea on how you plan to tackle the problem and to
address the issues previously described. It does not need to describe
specific solutions but their intuitive idea.
